# Swirl - Collision-Based Perlin Noise-Generated Color Field

## A simulated paint bucket. Made for my AP CS A Unit 2 Conditionals and Loops project.

Swirl is a physics engine that simulates and displays the physical interactions of particles of different color, which is generated by selecting a random starting point in the Perlin noise function. It represents this as a visual array of dots that collide with each other and the mouse, creating the effect of swirling paint. The program is written in Java and uses the Processing library for the visual output.

_After swirling the particles around a bit:_

### Concept

I was interested in coding natural systems, so I decided on the intersection between natural motion swirls and physics. See picture below for what I was envisioning.

### Methods

I used a single class Particle and an array of Particles to generate them on the screen. The particles are 1 px in diameter and fill the screen. Initially, a three-dimensional Perlin noise function based on x position, y position, and, optionally, time for smoothness, generates the color field of particles. Collision-based physics - including oblique collisions - manage interactions between particles. The mouse can also interact with these particles.

### Result
The particles use oblique collisions to swirl with each other, creating a satisfying paint/watercolor effect. Friction is used to slow down the particles over time.
